## What is AntDB?

AntDB is a distributed database with share nothing architecture. The goal of AntDB is to provide both write-scalability and massively parallel processing. AntDB is released under the Apache 2.0 license and we greatly welcome all new contributions.

AntDB provides the following features:

grammars and oci7)

* Distributed transaction(2PC) and global MVCC

* Dynamic expanding database cluster capacity
