# Save and count plans in PostgreSQL or/and AntDB

This plugin requires plugin pg_stat_statement, and plugin **pg_stat_statement** must load before adb_stat_statements.
If you need to work in an AntDB cluster, first make sure that the plugin **adb_global_views** is installed.

# How to use
1. Configure postgresql.conf, shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements,adb_stat_statements'.  
2. Restart PostgreSQL.  
3. Login PostgreSQL as super user. Execute some commands like:  
```shell
psql -U antdb -h localhost -d postgres
create extension if not exists adb_stat_statements cascade;
```
This extension will be created in the antdb schema  

4. Show all statement statistics.  
```shell
select * from antdb.adb_stat_statements;
```

5. Reset all statement statistics.  
```shell
select antdb.adb_stat_statements_reset();
```

# How to uninstall  
Login PostgreSQL as super user, execute  
```shell
psql -U antdb -h localhost -d postgres
drop extension adb_stat_statements cascade;
```
